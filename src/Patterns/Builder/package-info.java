 * DesktopBuilder interface that will have all methods to add the class properties
 * Class that implements DesktopBuilder and give their own implementation like DELL and HP also one method to return
 * Desktop type getProduct()/ getDesktop()
 * Director in which you pass your builder and specify methods to create a Desktop/Product like DELL toy desktop,
 * business desktop etc.
